Sentiment Analysis Methods and Their Use in Social Media Platforms
📄 Overview
This repository contains the research paper "A Review: Sentiment Analysis Methods and Their Use in Social Media Platforms" presented at the International Conference on Innovative Data Communication Technologies and Application (ICIDCA-2023).

The paper provides a systematic review of sentiment analysis techniques—focusing on lexicon-based, machine learning, and hybrid approaches—and their applications across various domains, with a particular emphasis on social media platforms like Twitter.

📚 Abstract
Sentiment analysis identifies positive, neutral, or negative opinions in text. It is widely used for improving customer service, predicting opinion polls, enhancing security awareness, and analyzing public perception in various domains.
This study reviews 23 peer-reviewed papers (from an initial set of 50) published between 2016 and 2023, analyzing their methodologies, platforms, and application contexts. Results show that both lexicon-based and machine learning methods yield comparable accuracy, with hybrid methods offering enhanced results.

🔍 Key Insights
Approaches Reviewed:

Lexicon-based (Intensity Scores, Parts-of-Speech)

Machine Learning (SVM, Naive Bayes, CNN, Genetic Algorithm, LSTM, BiLSTM, etc.)

Hybrid methods combining both approaches

Data Sources: Twitter dominates as the preferred platform due to availability and richness of content.

Applications:

Business strategy & customer feedback analysis

Security breach response

Health monitoring & disaster management

Sports sentiment tracking

Findings: Hybrid approaches often outperform individual methods, especially in handling unstructured data.
